It can be used to create a variety of different shapes and features, such as planes, slots, holes, bevels, arcs, and more. By adjusting the path, speed and feed of the cutter, as well as by using different types of cutters, highly precise machining results can be achieved.",
    "SUMERISE_DESCRIPTION_3": "In CNC milling, it is controlled by computer numerical control (CNC) technology. The CNC system receives pre-programmed instructions that will precisely define parameters such as the motion trajectory, speed and feed of the milling cutter to achieve high-quality milling results."

In this process, the drill bit is fixed to the spindle of a drilling press or other drilling equipment and rotated at high speed, then gradually advanced downward or diagonally into the workpiece to remove the material and create the desired hole.CNC drilling is a precise drilling operation that utilizes computer numerical control (CNC) technology. ",
    "SUMERISE_DESCRIPTION_3": "Precise control of drill position, speed, and feed is achieved by pre-programmed commands to control the precise position and movement of the drill bit to ensure that the diameter, depth, and positional accuracy of the hole meet the design requirements. At the same time, it is also necessary to select the appropriate drill type and cutting data to adapt to different workpiece materials and machining requirements."
